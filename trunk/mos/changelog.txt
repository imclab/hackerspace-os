MembershipNumber is not used anymore as own Fied, id is used for MembershipNumber

when adding a new User (Member) you create a MembershipPeriod from the day of entry until the end
of the month with KindOfMembership=free, then you create a another MembershipPeriod from the first
day of the next month with a KindOfMembership=normal (leave field 'until' empty)
